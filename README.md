# whatsappCloneReact

Creating a Whatsapp Clone using react native. 
My main aim by building this project is - 
1. Learn react native and how it can be used to build enterprise applications.
2. Understand Heroku deployment
3. Touch base again with node development.


Sources: I am using a bunch of sources to help me build this project
-https://www.codementor.io/codementorteam/build-a-whatsapp-messenger-clone-in-react-part-1-4l2o0waav 
I used this to understand how they did the node js and heroku set up. The entire tutorial is 99 bucks, so im using other means
to figure out how to make the front end using React native.
